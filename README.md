- Include 36 variables such as the number of guests, number of nights, number of rooms, etc.

## Data Preprocessing
1. Convert one row per order id to one row per user id
2. Derive RFM variables
3. Derive Categorical variables

- Convert probability to categorical levels
- Check the levels of each categorical variables using boxplots
